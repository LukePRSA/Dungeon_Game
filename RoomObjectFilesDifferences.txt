Differences between RoomObject (and its children) classes and ones displayed in plan document.

renamed Attack_projectile to Projectile as it was a simpler name for it

removed save_object functions from all classes except Player as the only thing that was saved with each object was the positions, as to simplify the saving process

changed approach_player function parameter of Melee_enemy class to just use a vector of the difference between player and enemy position since it also describes direction and the two parameters are unneeded

added calculator functions to Enemy class for distance in vector and scalar form of an enemy to simplify perform_ai functions in its children

removed change_body_colour from Room_object class as it can be easily replicated using get_body()->setFillColor

replaced Vector3 instances used for colour of an object's body with the sfml class for colours, Color

added is_triggered and toggle_active functions to Trap class to differentiate the trigger from has_collided of RoomObject and to allow traps to be disarmed

added enums to RoomObject for rotation/direction and type of shape the object is. The former is used in many of its children.

added has_hit pure virtual function to Enemy classes to seperate it from has_collided in case their bodies' actual collisions are needed

due to inconveniences with attempting collisions and polymorphism in a limited amount of time, minions array was removed from the boss. Replace by minions spawning in the room alongside the boss.

made Boss class inherit from MeleeEnemy since they use similar functions. The perform_ai function alongside others were overridden to fit the projectile attack.
